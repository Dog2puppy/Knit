Just drop in the module into ReplicatedStorage. Knit can also be used within a Rojo project. Standard workflow: Get Knit from the Roblox library. Place Knit directly within the ReplicatedStorage service. Rojo workflow: Get Knit [TODO] from the latest release on GitHub. Place Knit within your project. Use Rojo to point Knit to ReplicatedStorage. Basic Usage \u00b6 The core usage of Knit is the same from the server and the client. The general pattern is to create a single script on the server and a single script on the client. These scripts will load Knit, create services/controllers, and then start Knit. The most basic usage would look as such: 1 2 local Knit = require ( game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ). Knit ) Knit . Start (): await () That would be the necessary code on both the server and the client. However, nothing interesting is going to happen. Let's dive into some more examples. A Simple Service \u00b6 A service is simply a structure that serves some specific purpose. For instance, a game might have a MoneyService, which manages in-game currency for players. Let's look at a simple example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 local Knit = require ( game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ). Knit ) -- Create the service: local MoneyService = Knit . CreateService { Name = \"MoneyService\" ; } -- Add some methods to the service: function MoneyService : GetMoney ( player ) -- Do some sort of data fetch local money = someDataStore : GetAsync ( \"money\" ) return money end function MoneyService : GiveMoney ( player , amount ) -- Do some sort of data fetch local money = self : GetMoney ( player ) money = money + amount someDataStore : SetAsync ( \"money\" , money ) end Knit . Start (): await () Note It's better practice to put services and controllers within their own ModuleScript and then require them from your main script. For the sake of simplicity, they are all in one script for these examples. Now we have a little MoneyService that can get and give money to a player. However, only the server can use this at the moment. What if we want clients to fetch how much money they have? To do this, we have to create some client-side code to consume our service. We could create a controller, but it's not necessary for this example. First, we need to expose a method to the client. We can do this by writing methods on the service's Client table: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -- Money service on the server ... function MoneyService . Client : GetMoney ( player ) -- We already wrote this method, so we can just call the other one. -- 'self.Server' will reference back to the root MoneyService. return self . Server : GetMoney ( player ) end ... We can write client-side code to fetch money from the service: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 -- Client-side code local Knit = require ( game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ). Knit ) Knit . Start (): await () local moneyService = Knit . GetService ( \"MoneyService\" ) local money = moneyService : GetMoney () -- Alternatively, using promises: moneyService : GetMoneyPromise (): andThen ( function ( money ) print ( money ) end ) Under the hood, Knit is creating a RemoteFunction bound to the service's GetMoney method. Knit keeps RemoteFunctions and RemoteEvents out of the way so that developers can focus on writing code and not building communication infrastructure.
